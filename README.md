# CS305_SoftwareSecurity
Project Overview:
Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company providing retirement and investment planning services, needed to modernize their web application's security. I addressed this by implementing SHA-256 checksum verification for data integrity, generating SSL/TLS certificates, and configuring HTTPS to encrypt all communications. The most valuable aspect of this project was learning to distinguish between different types of vulnerabilities—the dependency-check scan initially showed 148 vulnerabilities, but analysis revealed these were in framework dependencies, not my code, which taught me to read security reports critically. I increased security through defense-in-depth: cryptographic hashing for integrity, TLS encryption for confidentiality, certificate-based authentication, and secure configuration management.
Technical Approach and Skills:
I ensured code security by following OWASP and NIST best practices—using approved algorithms (SHA-256, not MD5), standard Java security libraries, proper character encoding, and secure error handling. I verified functionality through compilation testing, browser-based endpoint testing, and OWASP Dependency-Check scans that confirmed my refactoring didn't introduce new vulnerabilities. Key tools and practices I'll use in future work include Maven for dependency management, Keytool for certificates, static analysis with Dependency-Check, and secure coding principles like least privilege and separation of configuration from code. For future employers, I can demonstrate my complete implementation of cryptographic security features, security scanning and analysis skills, HTTPS/SSL configuration experience, and ability to make algorithm choices based on industry standards—all crucial skills for any role involving secure software development in financial services or data-sensitive industries.
